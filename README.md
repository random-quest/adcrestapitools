Atlassian DC REST API tools

## Requirements
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| zsh | all scripts are zsh. Mostly, because we are developing on MacOs. Note: zsh version needs to be > 5.5 (release 2018) |
| jq | Naturally, we need a powerful tool to process JSON. With jq we found such a tool. https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ |
| xsv | I find it often more intuitive to work with CSV files. With xsv we have a fast and flexible tool. https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv |
| GNU sed | FIXME. Need to check if and why we need specific GNU sed features. |

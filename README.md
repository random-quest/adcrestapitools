Atlassian DC REST API tools

## Requirements
| Command | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `zsh` | Sorry, all scripts require `/bin/zsh`. Mostly, because we are developing on MacOs. Note: version needs to be greater than 5.5 (released 2018) `zsh --version` |
| `jq` | Naturally, we need a powerful tool to process JSON. With jq we found such a tool. https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ |
| `xsv` | I find it often more intuitive to work with CSV files. With xsv we have a fast and flexible tool. https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv |
| `GNU sed` | FIXME. Need to check if and why we need specific GNU sed features. |
